# RubyMotion Inspect

## What is it?

*RubyMotion Inspect* is the official app for the RubyMotion Inspect annual
conference.

## Getting started

Obviously you will need a working copy of [RubyMotion](http://rubymotion.com)
(1.34 at the time of writing this) and Xcode with command-line tools installed.
You'll also need to setup [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/) and Bundler on
your machine.

Once you have all this, simply run `bundle` the first time then `rake` to build
and launch the simulator (see RubyMotion docs for more informations).
