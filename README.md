# RubyMotion Inspect

## What is it?

*RubyMotion Inspect* is the official app for the RubyMotion Inspect annual
conference.

## Getting started

Obviously you will need a working copy of [RubyMotion](http://rubymotion.com) (1.34 at the time of writing this) and Xcode with command-line tools installed. You'll also need to setup [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/) and Bundler on
your machine.

To run the application:

1. `bundle`
2. `rake pod:install`
3. `rake`

See RubyMotion docs for more information.
