	<string>At the end of the conference on Thursday, we hope you will enjoy a local restaurant with your fellow attendees for dinner. There are lots of excellent choices in the area. \n\n But don't go too far! We will have one last hurrah back at Fort Mason, at 8pm! \n\n It will be awesome. We will socialize. There will be alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, and music.</string>
